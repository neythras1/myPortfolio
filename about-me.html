          I have always had to contend with having my passion and interest split into several disciplines. When I was growing up, this was a struggle. I was always told that I have to pick a path and stick with it. This decision seemed impossible to me because I had an equal love of design, math, science, technology and literature. It wasn’t until later on that I learned about Product Management and I realized there is a place for people like me. The characteristic that made me feel isolated ended up being the one that makes me unique. 
          <br><br>Once I became a Product Manager I knew it was what I was meant to do. Juggling teams, projects, clients, and the product itself is where I felt happiest. Bouncing between high technical engineering to design oriented marketing and everything in between gave the outlet I had been longing for. 
          <br><br>While math and science came naturally to me in high school, it wasn’t until junior year that I realized I needed more. Art and design was something I always explored in my hobbies, but I realized at some point that I needed all of these disciplines in my career. I decided to go to college for Industrial Design hoping to find a balance between all my interests but found it leaning heavily to the creative arts. Yearning for some technical challenges, I decided to become a Mechanical Engineer. While I got closer to the balance I was looking for, there was something missing. 
          <br><br>People close to me suggested Product Management knowing that I was looking for a career that could encompass all my interests. Once I became a Product Manager, it was like everything clicked. I realized what was missing in mechanical engineering was the opportunity to to organize and curate the big picture product, from business to marketing to engineering and everything in between. Product management is where my natural talents thrive, but also where I can continue to challenge and grow myself. 
          <br><br>I never want to stop learning and growing. For this reason I have committed myself to constantly gaining new skills. For example, I taught myself how to code in HTML/CSS and used this skill to create this website from scratch. Check out all the other skills I have learned in my resume under the “My Resume” tab. I am not afraid to pursue a challenge or to learn a new skill to continue growing and improving. 
          <br><br>Thanks for stopping by to learn about me! Check out the “Case Studies” tab to see how I analyze different products using Design Thinking.
